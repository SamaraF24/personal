            <p style="font-family: 'Curier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Student</p>
            <p>I am currently a student at Iowa State University. This semester I am taking SE309, SE319, COMS3270, CPRE2880, SE1660, SE1860, and COMS2300. 
                I am working towards my B.S. in Software Engineering, and I am hoping to graduate in December 2026. After that, I plan to continue my education 
                at Iowa State and work towards my Masters in Artificial Intelligence</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The second project is a word search algorithm, written in C, that
                    the size of the the word_search as the first parameter and the words 
                    to be hidden as the remaining parameters. This was the first assignment
                    for COMS3270.
